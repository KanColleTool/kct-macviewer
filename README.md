KanColleTool OS X Viewer
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/macviewer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/macviewer)

This is the Mac OS X viewer for (KanColleTool)[/KanColleTool/tool]. It is a port of the (Qt Viewer)[/KanColleTool/viewer] in Objective C, because flash does not work in QtWebKit on OS X.

It allows players to stream data directly from the client instead of getting information from the DMM servers directly, which could lead to a ban.

The viewer can also translate the game on-the-fly by modifying server response text
