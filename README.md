KanColleTool OS X Viewer
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/kct-macviewer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/kct-macviewer)

The **MacViewer** is an alternative implementation of the [KanColleTool Viewer](https://github.com/KanColleTool/kct-viewer) for Mac OS X, because Flash Player currently doesn't work properly with QtWebKit there.
