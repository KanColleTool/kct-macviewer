KanColleTool OS X Viewer
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/kct-macviewer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/kct-macviewer)

This is necessary because Flash Player currently doesn't work properly with QtWebKit there, the reason being that they started disregarding the NPAPI spec in a way that it doesn't like.
